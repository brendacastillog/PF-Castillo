## About Me :sunflower:
Hello! I'm Brenda Castillo, Graphic Designer and Illustrator working at Apptegy. I've started on the specialization for UX/UI Development in March of 2023 and this is one of the projects for the course. I'm a complete newbie when it comes to coding. Previously I only had experience with C#, so this is my first project using HTML and CSS and it's been a lot of fun.

## My Project :books:
Like in my previous list, one of my favorite hobbies is to read books. I've enjoyed reading them since I was a child and my taste for literary genres kept expanding as I kept reading more books. Sharing my thoughts and talking about stories with other people is something I'm really passionate about, so this project came from that idea. I wanted to create something similar to a literary blog but also a record of how many books I read throughout the year. 

The visual design for the project was inspired on my own nook for reading. It's a cozy, beige, love seat with a coffee table next to it and a stack of the books I'm reading at the moment. I wanted to project that feeling of warmth and vintage look for the blog but with also a bit of modern tones with the typography I chose.
